Developers
--

Make sure you have Node and npm installed. You'll need to have Grunt and Sass installed. Use these commands:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
gem install sass
```

You can then install all the project dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

Available Grunt tasks:

* `grunt` - will build the whole project.
* `grunt watch` - will watch for any file modifications and will build. Will also build on start.
* `grunt test` - will test the main app js file using `jshint` (more tests are coming soon).

For local development you can use Vagrant and you can check if the build passes using Travis-CI.
